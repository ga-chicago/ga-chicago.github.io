## Nah Let's Play Blackjack (and learn problem solving) (in Ruby)
![blackjack](http://www.sidebolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/blackjack_logo.png)

1. Using Ruby (and Sinatra?), construct the game of blackjack.
  - Rules
    1. Card values are 2-10 with facecards being worth 10, and a Aces being worth 1 or 11 (player's choice.)
    2. In blackjack, suits (hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs) hold no value.
    3. The dealer holds a shuffled deck (if you want me to bankrupt you) or decks of cards and deals out a card to each player including himself. Then deals out another card to each player including himself.
    4. The goal of the game is to get to a score of 21 with the combined cards without going over 21 or having a higher score than the dealer.
    5. You can receive another card from the deal in turn to increase the score of your cards.
    6. Complete rules are here: http://www.pagat.com/banking/blackjack.html
2. Start basic with the goal of the game to deal 2 cards to each player including the dealer and compare scores.
3. Build out from there.
4. You can use pry to figure out the logic
5. Bonus------- Render using Sinatra (Yay a basic Sinatra app is already built in the Morning exercise folder!)
