#### Build your own adventure

This evening, you will create a website that allows a user to "build their own adventure". We have provided a starting HTML file for you to add your own Javascript called `adventure.html`.

**Requirements**
- You need write an adventure story in a paragraph.
- Next, you'll need to remove key verbs and nouns. Your users will enter their own values for these.
- For example: _Today, I was [  x   ] to [  y   ]! On my way, I encountered [ z ]! I had to use my [  u   ] to escape the horrible clutches of [  q   ]! All in a day's work as a [ k ]!_
- You must use `prompt()` and `confirm()` to ask your users at least five questions. These questions will determine the words used in your story. These answers should be assigned to a variable.
  - *Bonus*: Use an `array` to store your user's input.
- You will then need to use string manipulation to build your adventure paragraph!
- You should use at least one **conditional statement** when building the loop. For example, if we were writing Zelda and the user's `name` variable was `ZELDA` the user would be presented a different world.
- Finally, `console.log()` your result!
- Once completed, work with a classmate to try each other's adventure stories out!
