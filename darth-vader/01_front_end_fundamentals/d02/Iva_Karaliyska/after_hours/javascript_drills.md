### Javascript Drills!

Tonight you are going to write Javascript statements to solve the following word problems. This assignment is to get you to start thinking like a developer.

#### 1. Pythagorean Theorem
Write a Javascript statement that can solve the pythagorean theorem. Save this is a new file inside of `01_front_end_fundamentals/d02/your_name/` called `pythagorean.js`.

#### 2. Create an array of your favourite things
We created files for our favourite things today, but now we need to create a new array! It will have 5 indices - **0 through 4**. Each one should be assigned a value that contains a favourite thing of yours. Save this in a new file called `favourites.js`.

#### 3. Write a statement that checks to see if a buyer is over 21
We want to sell the booze! However, we cannot sell to minors. Write an **if/else** statement that checks someone's age to be over 21. Save this in `alcohol_age_check.js`.

#### 4. Problems... problems everywhere!
Take the following math statements and turn them into Javascript statements. Save them inside `problems.js`! *Use variables where they make sense*

- Item A is greater than Item B
- Item C is equal to Item D
- 42 is less than 48
- Name is equal to Name
- Item E minus Item F equals Item G
- Item H squared equals Item I
- Item J times Item H
