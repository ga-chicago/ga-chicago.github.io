##Ordered Lists & Styling
- follow along with Tom creating an ordered list in HTML and using inline styles

### On Your Own
- create a new file in your 01_front_end_fundamentals/d04/your_name directory named orderedList.html

- open the file in Atom

- create your own ordered list using <ol> and <li> tags

- use inline styles to make your list badass (or as close as you can to BA before James introduces other much better ways to style)

- use a screen clip (cmd+shift+4) to share your list in Slack

###BONUS
- add a script element in the html

- make an array of your list

- write a for loop that iterates through all the items in your list

- console.log the items
