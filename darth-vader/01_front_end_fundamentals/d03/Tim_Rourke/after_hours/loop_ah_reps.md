## After Hours

#### Loop Reps!

1. In your own words, create a new file and define to you `What is the purpose of a loop?`
2. Create three arrays: an array of `Strings`, an array of `Numbers`, and a mixed array (one that contains both).
3. Create a `for` and `for-in` loop for each of the three arrays inside of a new file called `loop_ah.js`.

#### Basic DOM Styling

1. Create a new `html` file called `loops-ah.html`.
2. Inside of this file, create a set of `unordered lists` (`<ul>`).
3. Inside of each `<ul>`, add a `list item` (`<li>`) for each item the in arrays you created above.
4. Use an inline-stylesheet to style strings as `bold` and `orange` colour text for each `String`
5. Use an inline-stylesheet to style strings as `italic` and `purple` colour text for each `String`
6. Save the file for us to review!
