A loop allows me to process a collection of items, such as outputtinh strings in an array or adding the square of numbers, OR
calculating something that requires iteration without data, such as a timer.

Three arrays:
[ "New York","Mexico City","Toronto","Seattle","Los Angeles","Dallas","Tuscon","Omaha" ];
[ 32, 25, 11, 66, 27, 33, 167, 39, 51, 62 ];
[ "New York", -5, "Helen", "Fred", 1490, "Zero", 0, 311 ];
