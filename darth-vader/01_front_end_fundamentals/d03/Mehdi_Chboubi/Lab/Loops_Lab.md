## Loops and Array Lab!

This afternoon we want to build upon the foundation of loops. We're going to draw them out and then write them! On your own, you will need to work on the following:

1. With the provided graph paper/coloured pencils, write out an array of things that matter to you most.
2. Make sure you add your name somewhere on this paper!
3. Visually draw out the concept of `incrementing` (looping) through an Array in your own way. This should make sense to you.
4. On another sheet of paper, visually draw out how you would `pop()` and `push()` items from an array.
5. On yet another sheet of paper, visually draw out how you would `shift()` and `unshift()` items from an array.
6. Now, create a new `my_favourites.js` file in this directory.
7. Re-create your array as a variable inside of this file.
8. Create a `for` and a `for-in/foreach` loop inside of this file.
9. Inside of these loops, iterate through the array and `console.log()` each item.
10. Copy/paste your code from this file in the Chrome Developer console to verify if it works.
11. Upon completion, save all of your work and feel free to read the first two chapters of **Eloquent Javascript**.
