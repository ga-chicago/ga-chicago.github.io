# Social Media Page

## Let's Practice some CSS!

- Your client has asked you to build a social media profile page based on an already established design. Replicate this design, and include hometown, hobbies, favorites (have at least 3 categories), and/or any other social media categories. You can fill it details with Samuel L. Ipsum (http://slipsum.com/), Hipster Ipsum (http://hipsum.co/), or any other Lorem Ipsum generators.

- Be sure to give your company credit in the footer!
