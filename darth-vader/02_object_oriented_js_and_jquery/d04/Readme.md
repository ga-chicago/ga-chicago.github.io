### After Hours

- Style your Tic Tac Toe game!
- Add a new feature to your game using HTML/CSS/JS!
- A new feature could be (these are *our* suggestions)...
	* Create a hover effect on each button using the jQuery hover event
	* Displaying the current player
	* Changing the style of each button when clicked to match the user (ie: x == green, o == blue)
	* Real-time calculation to see who the winner is and display it!
	
**Bonus**: Implement all of the above features!
