## After Hours

#### 1. One more ERD...

* Create an ERD (paper, paint, photoshop, whatever...) for Instagram
* Take a photo with your camera / save it to your `05.../d01/your_name/` folder as `instagram_erd.png`
* You should have the following tables:
  * Users
  * Photos
  * Hashtags
* Unsure how to use Instagram? Ask a classmate or look it up!

#### 2. Migrations

* Create a `migrations.sql` for each of the four applications you had to model today!
* So create a database, connect to it, and add tables!
* Those apps are...
  * Paypal: users, purchases, gifts
  * Facebook: users, likes, status_updates
  * Huffington Post: sections, articles, authors
  * Reddit: users, subreddits, votes

#### BONUS

* Create a `migrations.sql` for your Instagram ERD!
