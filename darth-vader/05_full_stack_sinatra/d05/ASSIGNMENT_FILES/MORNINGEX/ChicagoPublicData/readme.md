1. Head to [Chicago Public Data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/)
2. Search for data that you want to display
3. Read the documentation for parameters
4. Make a directory with an index.html and directory named scripts that contains scripts.js
5. Use jQuery (hint I forgot to bring it in this morning in my semi-awake daze and couldn't figure out why I was getting an error)
6. Make an ajax call to CPD to display the data that you're interested in.
7. ????
8. Profit

- Bonus style and use skeleton
