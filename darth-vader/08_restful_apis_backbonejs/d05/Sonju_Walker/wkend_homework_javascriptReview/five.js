5. Conditional Trials

Create a logical block that detects if a user is able to purchase alcohol.
If so, console.log out that they may have a drink.
Else, warn them via console.log to not break the law.

var person = 18;
var drinkAge = 21;

if (person > drinkAge) {
  consloe.log('Have a corona on the house!');
}
 else {
   console.log('Your not 21 years old, go home.');
 }
