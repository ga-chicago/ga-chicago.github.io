Instead of hosting the last items on Heroku, I decided to learn a bit more about Linux servers and deployed them on my own server on subdomains. The interesting part of this was learning about how to configure reverse proxies in nginx, and how to create a daemonized service I could call/start/stop by name for Unicorn instances. All in all it made for a great weekend!

Thanks,

Tim
