##Check for Understanding

A class is essentially a blueprint. It stores data which allows you to create new instances of a class, which results in A LOT less code to type.

Getters and Setters are important because they allow you to get and retrieve data with a simple method call.

Inheritance basically is a way of sending data to other classes or children. The children classes inherit the methods and class variables of the parent classes.

args is very useful as it can be used as the argument in a method to accept any number of parameters. This is particularly useful when the number of arguments sent to the method is not certain.
