A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It names and describes the elements each instance of that class will contain at its creation.

Getters and Setters are functions of a Ruby object which allow us to read and change variables inside the object. Without getters/setters, the variables are inaccessible (unreadable/unchangeable).

Inheritance is the feature of objects and classes that passes variables and methods on to objects created from those objects and classes, so that they start as clones in structure/data.

The *args parameter is important so that a function can be customized or streamlined. Many math functions, for example, have very general cases that need boundary points, but have simplified versions that need only one or two inputs. The *args parameter allows the same function to be called for all cases, determining boundary points/simplifications from the number of inputs used/skipped.
