        The new Marvel Universe is getting a new Jade Giant in the form of Amadeus Cho in the first issue
         of its new (gosh, that's a lot of "new") comic-book title The Totally Awesome Hulk, set to be released
          in December.
      </p>
      <p>
        The upcoming series is penned by writer Greg Pak (Action Comics, Batman Superman, Storm, Turok) with his
         partner in crime, artist Frank Cho, and features a 19-year-old boy genius who is now one of the strongest
          beings in the whole of the Marvel Universe -- and he seems to be having a blast while at it!
      </p>
      <p>
        Amadeus Cho is described as a super genius, the seventh smartest person on the planet (according to the
         Pym-Von Doom raw calc scale, weâ€™re being told) who is far from being the conflicted, tormented green goliath
          Bruce Banner was. Talking of Banner, the new comic will also reveal what happened to him in the previous
           eight months.

        A head of the comic hitting shelves on Dec. 2, Marvel has unleashed a totally awesome 9-page preview. Check
         it out below! Are you looking forward to following the adventures of Amadeus Cho in Marvel's The Totally
          Awesome Hulk?
