    <h1><i>The Final Analysis</i></h1>
    <p>
      People are often unreasonable, illogical,
and self-centered.
Forgive them anyway.</p>

<p>If you are kind, People may accuse you
of selfish, ulterior motives.
Be kind anyway.</p>

<p>If you are successful, you will win some
false friends and some true enemies.
Succeed anyway.</p>

<p>If you are honest and frank,
people may cheat you.
Be honest and frank anyway.</p>

<p>What you spend years building, someone
could destroy overnight.
Build it anyway.</p>

<p>If you find serenity and happiness,
they may be jealous.
Be happy anyway.</p>

<p>The good you do today,
people will often forget tomorrow.
Do good anyway.</p>

<p>Give the world the best you have,
and it may never be enough.
Give the world the best you've got anyway.
</p>

<p>You see, in the final analysis,
it is between you and God.
It was never between you and them anyway.</p>
<h3> Mother Teresa</h3>
