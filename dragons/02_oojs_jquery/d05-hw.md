## Weekend Practice

Over the past two weeks we have covered a lot of content. Some of the things we have covered are:

* Javascript and programming fundamentals 
* Object-oriented programming techniques
* Basic HTML and CSS
* Fundamental design layout and structure for websites
* How to manipulate the DOM using Javascript **and** jQuery
* To to listen for events and do things when they are triggered
* How to include resources on your page (such as CSS and Javascript)
* How to use variables in CSS using Sass to precompile CSS

This weekend, we would like you to take these skills and create a small project that demonstrates your ability to use them!

#### Getting Started

* Create a folder inside of `02_oojs/your_name/` called `weekend`
* Inside of your folder, create a structure that mimics the following: `index.html`, `styles/main.scss`, and `scripts/app.js`.
* Create something that utilizes the skills above! This is your playground - create whatever you'd like.
* When you've completed, `add`, `commit`, and `push origin master`
* Create a pull request in Github for your submission
